# Supermarket

The SuperMarket project is the final project for my Web Development course at "John Bryce".

This project was generated with Angular, NodeJS and MySQL.

As a user, one can register and log into their account. Once logged in, a wide variety of groceries are available for purchase.

Through this website one can add products to their cart and once ready, put in their purchase including the desired address and delivery date.

As an admin, one can edit an existing product, or add a new product including its name, category, price and display image.
